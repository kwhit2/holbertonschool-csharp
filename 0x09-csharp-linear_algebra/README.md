## Notes
- To sum two vectors simply add their corresponding x, y & z values/coordinates.
- The length or magnitude of a vector is calculated with the pythagorean theorm (square root of x^2 + y^2).
- To multiply a vector by a scalar, multiply each component separately.
- Dot product: Muliply corresponding values & add those products together to get the Dot Product.
